Overview
Thalassemias are inherited (autosomal recessive) blood disorders characterized by reduced production of hemoglobin, leading to anemia. Symptoms can range from none to life-threatening, and include fatigue, pale skin, enlarged spleen, jaundice, growth delay, bone deformities, pulmonary hypertension, and dark urine. Children may experience slower growth and development. 
Types of Thalassemia
Alpha‑thalassemia: caused by faulty production of the alpha globin chains (four genes involved). Severity depends on how many genes are affected:
Silent carrier (1 gene): usually asymptomatic
Trait/minor (2 genes): mild anemia
Hemoglobin H disease (3 genes): moderate‑to‑severe anemia
Alpha‑thalassemia major (4 genes): fatal in utero unless treated with intrauterine transfusions 
Beta‑thalassemia: caused by mutations in one or two beta globin genes:
Minor (heterozygous): mild or no symptoms
Intermedia: moderate anemia
Major (Cooley's anemia): severe anemia usually apparent within 6–24 months of age 
Pathophysiology
Hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta chains. Mutations in globin gene regions impair synthesis of these chains, causing ineffective erythropoiesis, premature destruction of red blood cells, anemia, and iron overload from increased absorption and transfusions. Compound heterozygosity with other hemoglobinopathies (e.g. HbE, HbS) can modify clinical severity. 
Symptoms
Varies with level of severity:
Minor: often asymptomatic or mild fatigue
Intermedia: anemia requiring occasional care
Major: life-threatening anemia, growth delays, splenomegaly, bone deformities
In utero: hydrops fetalis if alpha‑thalassemia major 
Diagnosis
Blood tests (CBC, hemoglobin electrophoresis), DNA analysis, and prenatal genetic screening detect specific globin gene mutations. Family history and ancestry (e.g. Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, African) inform risk assessment. 
Management and Treatment
Mild forms: typically managed with counseling and possibly folic acid supplementation; occasional transfusion during stress/crises
Transfusion‑dependent thalassemia (TDT) (e.g. beta‑thalassemia major, hemoglobin H disease): lifelong red cell transfusions every few weeks, plus iron chelation therapy (e.g. deferoxamine, deferiprone, deferasirox) to prevent iron overload
Non‑transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) (e.g. intermedia): may not need regular transfusions but require monitoring and management during crises 
Bone marrow / stem cell transplantation: potential cure if a compatible donor is available
Gene therapy: including CRISPR‑based editing of patient’s own stem cells (e.g. betibeglogene autotemcel), experimental but promising 
History
First characterized in 1925 (Thomas Cooley), the term “thalassemia” was coined in 1932 by George Whipple, both deriving from Greek roots (“thalassa” = sea, “haima” = blood) due to prevalence in Mediterranean populations.
Thalassemia: Understanding, Care, and Blood Donation
What is Thalassemia?
Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the body's inability to produce adequate amounts of healthy hemoglobin - the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. This genetic condition results in fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal, leading to anemia.
Types of Thalassemia
Alpha Thalassemia:
Caused by deletions or mutations in the alpha-globin genes
Ranges from silent carriers to severe forms like Hemoglobin H disease and Hydrops fetalis
Beta Thalassemia:
Results from mutations in the beta-globin gene
Includes Thalassemia Minor (trait), Thalassemia Intermedia, and Thalassemia Major (Cooley's anemia)
Symptoms and Severity
Mild Forms (Thalassemia Minor/Trait):
Often asymptomatic or very mild anemia
May cause slight fatigue or mild anemia
Usually doesn't require treatment
Moderate to Severe Forms:
Severe anemia and fatigue
Pale skin and jaundice
Delayed growth and development in children
Bone deformities (especially facial bones)
Enlarged spleen and liver
Heart problems
Frequent infections
Treatment and Care
Blood Transfusions:
Regular blood transfusions are the primary treatment for severe thalassemia
Typically needed every 2-4 weeks
Help maintain adequate hemoglobin levels and reduce complications
Iron Chelation Therapy:
Essential for patients receiving regular transfusions
Removes excess iron that accumulates from repeated transfusions
Prevents organ damage from iron overload
Medications include deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox
Other Supportive Care:
Folic acid supplementation
Regular monitoring of organ function
Vaccination against infections
Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation in severe cases
Gene therapy (emerging treatment option)
Blood Donation and Thalassemia
Donation Eligibility:
People with thalassemia minor/trait can often donate blood
Those with moderate to severe thalassemia typically cannot donate due to anemia
Each blood center has specific eligibility criteria
Special Blood Needs:
Thalassemia patients requiring transfusions need carefully matched blood
Extended phenotyping may be necessary to prevent alloimmunization
Some patients develop antibodies requiring rare blood types
Regular donors help maintain adequate blood supply
Community Support:
Family members and friends often organize blood drives
Some patients participate in directed donation programs
Community awareness helps ensure blood availability
Living with Thalassemia
Regular Medical Care:

Frequent monitoring by hematologists
Regular assessment of iron levels and organ function
Cardiac and liver function evaluation
Endocrine system monitoring
Bone health assessment

Quality of Life:

With proper treatment, many people with thalassemia lead normal lives
Education and career goals remain achievable
Family planning requires genetic counseling
Support groups provide valuable resources and community

Prevention and Screening:

Genetic counseling for at-risk couples
Prenatal testing available
Carrier screening in high-risk populations
Newborn screening programs in many countries

Genetic Considerations
Thalassemia follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, meaning both parents must carry the gene for a child to have the severe form. Genetic counseling is crucial for:

Understanding inheritance risks
Family planning decisions
Prenatal diagnosis options
Extended family screening

The management of thalassemia has improved dramatically over recent decades, with many patients now living into adulthood and beyond with appropriate care. Early diagnosis, regular monitoring, and advances in treatment continue to improve outcomes for those affected by this condition.
